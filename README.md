## 🤔 What is Sucklessthing?

BanditHijo's Suckless script for manage & maintain the suckless app.

## 📢 Info!

I've renamed `suckmerge2` to `suckmerge`.

## 🛠️ Installation

Just run,

```shell
$ ./install.sh
```

This `install.sh` will automatically copy all suckscript to **~/.local/bin/**.

If you doesn't have `~/.local/bin` on your `PATH`, it will create for you.

If you does have, don't worry, it **will not** replace all your files inside local path.

Just run it, you'll be safe.

⛑️ **IMPORTANT!** You should to define your local PATH first. Or all suckscript that copied on **~/.local/bin/** can't be accessed from your shell. I dont want to describe here, just googling yaa.
